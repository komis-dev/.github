## Introduction

KOMIS is a firm that specializes in offering management consulting services with a focus on project and program management in the realm of international development. Through our extensive experience in collaborating with international donors, we have developed a unique approach that combines academic expertise with practical know-how from the field. Our aim is to help our clients design and execute interventions that deliver excellent results and have a lasting impact.

At KOMIS, we take pride in our ability to work closely with our clients, listening carefully to their needs and requirements. Rather than offering a one-size-fits-all solution, we work collaboratively to find the best answer that fits our clients' specific context. We believe that this approach is key to achieving success, as it allows us to tailor our services to the individual needs of each client and ensure that our solutions are practical, effective, and sustainable.

Our team of experts has an in-depth understanding of the complexities and challenges associated with international development projects. We recognize the importance of balancing the needs of multiple stakeholders, such as local communities, governments, and international organizations, to achieve a successful outcome. This requires a deep understanding of the social, economic, and political factors that affect development projects in different regions of the world.

At KOMIS, we are committed to providing our clients with the highest level of service. We leverage our extensive network of contacts in the international development community to bring together the best resources and expertise to achieve our clients' goals. Our approach is grounded in collaboration, flexibility, and a deep commitment to achieving lasting impact. We believe that by working together, we can achieve great things and make a positive difference in the world.

## Experimental IT 

In our IT department, we have a passion for exploring new technologies and experimenting with cutting-edge tools. We believe that staying up-to-date with the latest advancements is key to providing the best possible service to our customers. To facilitate collaborative work and share our findings, we decided to create a GitHub page where we can store and document our projects, experiments, and code snippets. By leveraging the power of Git and GitHub, we can work together on our experiments, share knowledge, and receive feedback from our peers. This collaborative approach enables us to stay agile, adapt quickly to changing circumstances, and ultimately deliver the best possible results. We are excited about this new initiative and look forward to sharing our work with the broader IT community.

## Focus

In our IT department, we have a strong focus on VBA development for our in-house tools, which is what this page will mostly be about. We believe that utilizing VBA allows us to streamline our workflows and increase our team's efficiency. To further promote this efficiency and expand our knowledge base, we have made the decision to share our work with others in the company. By doing so, we hope to offer non-IT members of our team an opportunity to learn more about the power of IT and how it can improve their own workflows. We believe that everyone can benefit from a basic understanding of programming and technology, and we are excited to provide resources and training to our colleagues to help them achieve this. Through these efforts, we hope to build a more collaborative and knowledgeable team that can work together to achieve our shared goals.
